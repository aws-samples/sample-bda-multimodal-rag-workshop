    "# Image Analysis with Amazon Bedrock Data Automation: Seeing Beyond Text\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook expands your journey with Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) by moving beyond text-based content to explore the rich world of visual data. While document processing lays the foundation for structured extraction, image analysis represents a fundamental shift in how we interact with information that cannot be captured in text alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through this notebook, you'll build capabilities to:\n",
    "- Extract textual information embedded within images\n",
    "- Identify and analyze visual objects and logos\n",
    "- Generate comprehensive descriptions of visual content\n",
    "- Classify images according to standard taxonomies\n",
    "- Extract custom attributes from specialized image types\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) to analyze images and extract valuable insights. BDA can identify text, logos, objects, and generate summaries from images, making it powerful for various image analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this enhanced notebook, we'll focus on the core BDA workflow for image analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preparing a sample image\n",
    "2. Creating a BDA project with standard and custom output configurations\n",
    "3. Processing the image with BDA\n",
    "4. Analyzing the results\n",
    "\n",
